				<p>If the Up by number is greater than zero than you are doing well :) and expected to spend less than the Expense projection you established at the beginning of the month. If the Down by number is red then you are spending more than your daily budget on average and may exceed the Expense projection you established at the beginning of the month. Therefore, build your tomorrow one day at a time and spend less than your daily budget or less than your Up by number.</p>
