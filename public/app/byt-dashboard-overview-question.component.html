				<p>At the beginning of the month, take some time and estimate how much income you'll receive, how much in bills you'll pay, and how much in expenses you'll incur for that specific month. Try and under estimate your income and over estimate your bills and expenses so that at the end of the month, you may be pleasantly surprised.</p>
				<p>Then as you progress through the month and record every transaction, compare how much income you've actually received, how much in bills you've actually paid, and how much in expenses you've actually incurred against your projections. A green and positive number in the +/- column in the Income and Savings rows means that you've earned and saved more money than expected which is great.A red and negative number in the +/- column in the Bills and Expenses rows means that you've exceeded your projections for those two buckets which is not ideal.</p>
				<p>Add your projections at the bottom of this page.</p>
